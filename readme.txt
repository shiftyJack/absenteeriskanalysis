This project uses data from the Department of Education in California. It focuses on chronic absenteeism from 2016-17 to 2022-23 with the exception of 2019-20. The data can be found here: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesabd.asp

This data set features the number of enrolled students, "Chronic Absenteeism Eligible Cumulative Enrollment", and the number of those students that are chronically absent, "Chronic Absenteeism Count", for every demographic group for each school in California. The demographic groups consist of: 
  
  RB = African American
  RI = American Indian or Alaska Native
  RA = Asian
  RF = Filipino
  RH = Hispanic or Latino
  RD = Did not Report
  RP = Pacific Islander
  RT = Two or More Races
  RW = White
  GM = Male
  GF = Female
  GX = Non-Binary Gender (Beginning 2019–20)
  GZ = Missing Gender
  SE = English Learners
  SD = Students with Disabilities
  SS = Socioeconomically Disadvantaged
  SM = Migrant
  SF = Foster
  SH = Homeless
  GRKN = Kindergarten (GRK prior to 2020–21)
  GR13 = Grades 1–3
  GR46 = Grades 4–6
  GR78 = Grades 7–8
  GRK8 = Grades K–8
  GR912 = Grades 9–12
  GRUG = Ungraded Elementary and Secondary (Retired in 2017–18)
  TA = Total

The project analysed chronic absentees pre-covid, the year of virtual learning after covid and the following year when students returned to in-person instuction. The analysis found that elementary absentee rates increased to match the absentee rates of grades 9-12 which historically outpaced elementary substantically. This may be evidence that elementary students were being sent to school while showing symptoms of sickness before the pandemic where this would not be tolderate after the pandemic. Additoinally, the analysis found that the Race/Ethnicity groups labeled RB and RI had a higher rate of chronic absense during the year of virtual learning, implying they may have had less access to technology since their attendance rates returned to pre-covid levels once in-person instruction returned.
